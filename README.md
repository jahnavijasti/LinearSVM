# LinearSVM

This code implements fast gradient algorithm on Linear Support Vector Machine with squared hinge loss.

The *objective* function calculates the objective of the SVM with squared hinge loss, while *grad_obj* calculated the gradient.
The *backtrack* function implements the backtracking rule.
The *fastgradient* us the main function that implements the Linear Support Vector Machine.
*misclass_error* function calculates the Mis-classification error on test set.
